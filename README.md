**Kitesense** is a dedicated control center for running and manage Typesense on any Kubernetes cluster. It lets you launch and operate Typesense deployments anywhere, track their health, and coordinate multiple environments from a single place. Designed for clarity and speed, Kitesense streamlines the entire lifecycle of your search infrastructure. Your Typesense clusters, anywhere, anytime. Run them how you like them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Kitesense is a repurposed derivative of the original [Kite](https://github.com/zxh326/kite) project. All credit for the foundation and core design goes to the Kite maintainers.

## 📦 Project Status

- Latest version: **0.3.5**
- Contributions welcome! See [FAQ](https://akyriako.github.io/typesense-operator-docs/docs/faq) and [Development](https://akyriako.github.io/typesense-operator-docs/docs/development)

### Relationship to the Upstream

Kitesense is a **hard-fork** of the open-source project [Kite](https://github.com/zxh326/kite). This means the codebase was copied at a specific point in time and then adapted, restructured, and extended to serve a different purpose: managing and deploying Typesense clusters on any Kubernetes environment.

Because of the above:

- Kitesense evolves independently. Development is no longer tied to the direction, roadmap, or release cycle of the original Kite project.
- Features and behavior may diverge. While Kitesense inherited foundational components from Kite, its functionality, UI, and architecture will continue to shift toward the needs of Typesense deployment and lifecycle management.
- Upstream updates are not automatically merged. Improvements made in Kite after the fork will not be pulled in unless explicitly adopted and manually integrated and only when they align with Kitesense’s goals.
- Credit remains with the original authors. The core concepts and initial implementation were made possible by the Kite maintainers, whose work provided the starting point for this project.

Kitesense stands on the shoulders of Kite, but is developed as its own focused, long-term solution for Typesense cluster orchestration.

## 🪁 Get Started

Kitesense can be installed as a solo Docker container, as optional component of [TyKO](https://github.com/akyriako/typesense-operator) (Typesense Kubernetes Operator) or as independent deployment in a separate management cluster designated to manage all your Typesense clusters on local or remote Kubernetes environments.

### Docker

To run Kitesense using Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 akyriako78/kitesense:latest
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 akyriako78/kitesense:latest
```

### Kubernetes

```bash
helm repo add kitesense https://akyriako.github.io/kitesense
helm repo update

helm upgrade --install kitesense kitesense/kitesense -n typesense-system --create-namespace
```

### Local Development

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akyriako/kitesense.git
cd kitesense
   ```

#### Build the project

```bash
make deps
make build
```

#### Run the static build

```bash
make run
```

#### Run with hot reload

```bash
make dev
```

Open now your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to use Kitesense in development mode.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Any change on the backend Go project will require restarting with `make dev`. The hot-reloading feature applies only for frontend TypeScript changes.

### Remote Container Development

Any IDE that supports [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), but in this case everything is tailored for Visual Studio Code, will build a container with all the necessary prerequisites to get you started creating content immediately based on the extensions
and features defined in **devcontainer.json**. A `typescript-node:1-20-bookworm` container will be spawned with the following extras pre-installed:

* **Visual Studio Code Extensions**

  - JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly
  - React Native Tools
  - ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets, Simple React Snippets
  - Simple React Snippets
  - Npm Intellisense, Npm Dependency, Path Intellisense
  - Git Graph
  - Resource Monitor
  - YAML
  - Thunder Client
  - Go
  - NeoXP Golang Tools

* **Features**

  - Git
  - Docker-in-Docker
  - Go
  - GolangCI Lint
  - GoReleaser

* **Post-Create Command**

  - `make deps && make build`

#### Add your own Extensions

You can add your own extensions in your Dev Container and customize it to the fullest. By right-clicking the desired extension in the *Marketplace* and choosing the *Add to devcontainer.json* the extension will be installed and activated the next time you rebuild your Dev Container.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can afterwards rebuild your container so the changes take effect, with our without using cache, in the latter  case it will rebuild the container from scratch.

#### Git Credentials

The Git extension will automatically forward your local **SSH agent**, if one is running otherwise it will use directly the git configuration of your local host. In that way you can take advantage of keeping tight control of your credentials and your SSH keys in one place, your local machine, and not spreading them individually to every new development enviroment.
